def kabsch_umeyama(A, B):
    '''
    Uses the Kabsch-Umeyama algorithm (least squares minimization) to align the
    vectors in set B with the reference set in A.  A and B should be matrices of
    N-Dimensional vectors, where each vector is a row.

    Returns the translation/rotation/scaling parameters and the tranformed B.
